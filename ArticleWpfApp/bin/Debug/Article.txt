Is Running a Marathon Under Two Hours Possible ?
	Will a human ever be able to run that fast? Currently, the world record for the 42.195 km (26.219 miles) distance is held by the Kenyan Dennis Kimetto.
His time of 2:02:57 hours was achieved at the Berlin Marathon of 2014.
	For many years, long distance runners have been trying to get nearer and nearer to the magical mark of two hours. 
Studies published in the past by medical and athletic experts have come to the conclusion that running a marathon under 2 hours can be done.
They even see a time of around 1:57 as the fastest a human can ever run. However, we will have to wait at least a decade or longer for this to happen.
	An athlete would have to have the perfect body size and weight, the right running strategy and of course, the right nutrition.
Since the beginning of the modern Olympic Games in 1896, athletes have tried to run long distance races as fast as possible.
In 1900, the marathon world record was at around 3 hours. In the following 30 years, men were able to reach a mark of 2:30. 
As time went on achieving faster times became more and more difficult. In the last 15 years, for example, the world record has improved  by only 3 minutes.
In the past years, several East African runners have been tested positive and many of them banned.
